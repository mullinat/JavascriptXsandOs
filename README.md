Design
Situation Brainstorming
  I want to be able to play X's and O's using javascript
  I want everything to be done with a mouse
Requirements
  display information to the user
  be able to click on specific locations
  be able to specifically control the look of the page
  be able to update the information being displayed very specifically
System Flow
  start a new game
  tell players to choose a piece
  players click that they have chosen a piece
  computer tells who goes first
  person clicks place
  second person clicks place
  play until someone wins
  display winner or cats game




Ideation
